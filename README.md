# django_projects-mysite
This includes many Django apps based on Dr. Charles Russell Severance's "Django for Everybody Specialization" on Coursera. It also includes apps based on the tutorials of the Django documentation (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/intro/tutorial0x/).  I experimented extensively with these apps, and many of them are incomplete.
To run this code, you have to create your .env file. Look at mysite/settings.py closely.  You will see what should be included in your .env file.  You also need to set up your database.  The tutorials of the Django Documentation will be helpful, especially #2.  I put these projects on PythonAnywhere.  
Perhaps it would be easier to start with Dr. Chuck's courses rather than working on my code.  Good luck!
