This includes many Django apps based on Dr. Charles Russell Severance's "Django for Everybody Specialization" on Coursera. It also includes apps based on the tutorial of the Django documentation (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/intro/tutorial0x/).  I experimented extensively with these apps, and many of them are incomplete.
